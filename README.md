## Hi there 👋🏼

👩‍💻 I'm a Data Scientist & Python Developer with an academic background in Translation & Linguistics. I specialize in NLP (especially speech recognition, machine translation, chatbots), but I enjoy making forecasts and automating processes just as much. So far, I've applied my skills mainly in university research and online-marketing at two startups in Berlin.

👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 Besides, I contribute as a Marketing Coordinator to the Berlin Chapter of Women in Data.
