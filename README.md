## Hi there 👋🏼

👩‍💻 I'm a Data Scientist & Python Developer with an academic background in Translation & Linguistics. I specialize in NLP (especially speech recognition, machine translation, and chatbots), but I enjoy making forecasts and automating processes just as much. Check out my [projects](https://github.com/lorenanda?tab=repositories) and [blog](https://lorenaciutacu.com/).
