## Hi there üëã

ü§ñ I'm a data scientist and NLP developer with a background in translation and linguistics. Quite predictably, my main interests are machine translation and conversational AI, but also data science for social causes. I mainly use Python, but sometimes also R.

üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß Besides, I contribute as a Marketing Coordinator to the Berlin Chapter of Women in Data.

üë©‚Äçüíª If you'd like to work with me, please contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorena-ciutacu/) or [on my website](https://lorenaciutacu.com/contact/).
