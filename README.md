## Hi there 👋🏼

🤖 I'm an aspiring Data Scientist & Python Developer with an academic background in Translation & Linguistics, currently enrolled in a Data Science Bootcamp. Quite predictably, my main interest is in NLP (especially machine translation, speech processing, emotion recognition), but I enjoy automating processes and building apps with Python just as much. So far, I've applied my skills mainly in the online marketing field at two digital startups in Berlin.

👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 Besides, I contribute as a Marketing Coordinator to the Berlin Chapter of Women in Data.
