### Hi there 👋

🤖 I'm a data scientist and NLP developer with a background in translation and linguistics. Quite predictably, my main interests are machine translation and conversational AI, but also data science for social causes. I mainly use Python, but sometimes also R.

👩‍👩‍👧‍👧 Besides, I contribute as a Marketing Coordinator to the Berlin Chapter of Women in Data.

👩‍💻 If you'd like to work with me, please contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorena-ciutacu/) or [on my website](https://lorenaciutacu.com/contact/).
